            <p>Since forming in early 2005, Remove the Veil has been on an unstoppable mission to spread the word about
                their unique brand of hard-rocking, loud and fast southern metal.</p>
            <p>But that’s not the only reason the guys in Remove the Veil take the stage. Taking their name from a
                passage in 2 Corinthians 3:14, Remove the Veil has a purpose to share: “We feel like this is what God
                wants us to do as a band–reach kids by letting them know that you can be a Christian and still have
                fun.”

            </p>
            <p>Their hard-pounding rhythms and intricate guitar work coupled with solid, driving bass lines provide a
                platform that compliments the interwoven vocal patterns to create an unmistakable sound.

            </p>
            <p>With their influences ranging from Merle Haggard to Metallica, the band blends a mix of southern rock,
                metal and hardcore into a genre that blurs the lines between mainstream and underground.

            </p>
            <p>The band was signed to Facedown Records in March 2007, and their debut album, Another Way Home, was
                released in October 2007.
