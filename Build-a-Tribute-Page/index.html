            <p>The two main sources of information by which we have access to the earliest segments of Paul's
                career
                are the Bible's Book of Acts and the autobiographical elements of Paul's letters to the early
                church
                communities. Paul was likely born between the years of 5 BC and 5 AD. The Book of Acts indicates
                that
                Paul was a Roman citizen by birth, more affirmatively describing his father as such, but Helmut
                Koester
                takes issue with the evidence presented by the text.(Acts 16:37, Acts 22:25–29)</p>

            <p>While he was still fairly young, he was sent to Jerusalem to receive his education at the school of
                Gamaliel, one of the most noted rabbis in history. The Hillel school was noted for giving its
                students
                a balanced education, likely giving Paul broad exposure to classical literature, philosophy, and
                ethics. Nothing more is known of his background until he takes an active part in the martyrdom of
                Stephen.</p>

            <p>Paul confesses that "beyond measure" he persecuted the church of God prior to his
                conversion.Although
                we know from his biography and from Acts that Paul could speak Hebrew, modern scholarship suggests
                that
                Koine Greek was his first language.</p>

            <p>Paul's conversion can be dated to 31–36 by his reference to it in one of his letters. In Galatians
                1:16
                Paul writes that God "was pleased to reveal his son to me." According to the account in Acts, it
                took
                place on the road to Damascus, where he reported having experienced a vision of the resurrected
                Jesus.</p>

            <p>After his conversion, Paul went to Damascus, where Acts 9 states he was healed of his blindness and
                baptized by Ananias of Damascus. Paul says that it was in Damascus that he barely escaped death.
                Paul
                also says that he then went first to Arabia, and then came back to Damascus. Some suppose he
                actually
                traveled to Mount Sinai for meditations in the desert.</p>

            <p>This was the beginning of Paul's ministry. He would be a part of many journey's. He was also spent a
                lot
                of time as a prisoner. He wrote letters to churches in different regions. These letters would
                eventually make up most of the Bible's New Testament.</p>

            <p>The New Testament does not say when or how Paul died. The date of Paul's death is believed to have
                occurred after the Great Fire of Rome in July 64, but before the last year of Nero's reign, in
                68. Paul's death is described in a number of sources.</p>

            <p class="close">Paul is such a fascinating person to me. He was a man who studied under the best
                teachers
                of his day, but was able to have an encounter and think for himself. For more detials <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Apostle"
